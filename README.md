_I know this doesn't use Vite, but I realized that too late into the process haha_

# Summary

I wanted to try out Svelte finally, and here we are. Something that makes an API call and uses the data. At some future point I'll have to get more in-depth with it.

# Running Locally

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

And for tests (make sure you have your local host running)

```
npm cypress:open
```
